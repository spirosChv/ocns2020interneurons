	<h3> Short bio</h3>
	<p> Alexandra Tzilivaki, received her BSc and MSc in Biology, with honors, from the University of Crete in Greece. She is currently a PhD candidate researcher in the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Dietmar Schmitz in Charite  Medical School Berlin in Germany. She is also a member of Panayiota Poirazi Laboratory in IMBB FORTH in Crete.
		Alexandra is especially interested in understanding the contribution of interneurons in learning and memory processes with an emphasis to dendritic functions and hippocampal oscillations, via the utilization of  modelling and experimental approaches. 
		Her work has been supported among others by the Einstein Foundation, by the Onassis Foundation and by Google.
